Last year there was still by and large agreement � for instance at the annual conference of the German Ethics Council devoted to this topic � that there would be sufficient time for the necessary thorough and comprehensive reflection since applications in humans were still far away from actual implementation. Recent developments, however, demonstrate that, in this particularly sensitive area, research has advanced far more quickly than expected and precedents are being created at least in some countries. As, however, this touches not only on national interests but also on the interests of mankind as a whole, there is a need for broadly-based discussion and international regulation. in August 2017 an international research group led by the oregon health & Science University in Portland (USA) published research findings on the germline treatment of a dominant hereditary disorder in the earliest stage of human life.1 the goal of the researchers was to correct a gene defect which causes a serious hereditary myocardial disease using what is known as genome editing (�genetic scissors�). the genome editing was done as part of artificial fertilisation. According to the researchers, the sperm cells used to produce the embryos carrying the disease gene came from an adult cardiomyopathy patient whose disease is treated in the usual way, with a defibrillator and medication. Already in April 2015 and April 2016 Chinese research groups had published the results of experiments involving the correction, by means of genome editing, of a genetic predisposition for the blood disorder thalassemia in human embryos2, and the generation of genetic resistance to hiV3. in comparison to these experiments, however, the American-Chinese-South Korean consortium of scientists around the US-American stem cell researcher, Shoukhrat mitalipov, have since reported far better results. mitalipov�s group observed that the proportion of what are known as mosaic embryos � embryos in which the desired genetic modification could only be implemented in some of the cells � could be considerably reduced. Furthermore, there were no unintended (off-target) modifications in other genes in the, albeit, few embryos examined. 1 2 ma, h. et al.

Leading researchers, even those who are usually willing to push the boundaries of research into areas prohibited elsewhere, advocated caution and moratoria on the application of genome editing in human embryos.5 in october 2015 the UnESCo international Bioethics Committee called on the member states to agree on a joint moratorium on germline modification by genome editing.6 Civil society organisations and religious representatives were also concerned about the intention to systematically intervene in the human genome. PAGE 3 the open questions were discussed internationally in a diverse manner.7 in Germany, for example, the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and humanities8 published an opinion in July 2015 as did, in September 2015, the German national Academy of Sciences Leopoldina together with the German research Foundation, the national Academy of Science and Engineering and the Union of the German Academies of Sciences and humanities.9 the German Ethics Council extensively discussed the ethical challenges posed by this topic at several public meetings and in a close exchange with other national ethics committees.10 on the international level the debate reached an initial milestone at the international Summit on human Gene Editing (�Washington Summit�) in december 2015. it is worth noting that the lead organisers were the national science academies in those countries that use genome editing in embryo-consuming research particularly intensively at present and will surely continue to do so in the future: the USA, the United Kingdom and China. Contrary to some expectations no moratorium was announced in the final statement; reference was merely made to the considerable remaining risks and the regulatory ambiguities � up to the level of international law � which would constitute obstacles to clinical germline interventions.11 however, there was also no likelihood of clinical use in the foreseeable future: the risks still seemed to be uncontrollable in the long term and the chances of success too limited. Furthermore, in many countries pre-implantation genetic diagnosis offers an � albeit itself controversial � alternative of preventing the propagation of severe hereditary disorders in individual cases. this guarded evaluation of genome editing for the purpose of germline intervention was also the tenor of numerous statements given at the annual conference of the German Ethics Council in June 2016. on that occasion the Ethics Council 7 Cf. by way of example, the discussion process of the British nuffield Council on Bioethics on https://nuffieldbioethics.org/project/genomeediting. 8 Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and humanities (2015): human genome surgery � towards a responsible evaluation of a new technology. https://edoc.bbaw.de/files/2486/2015_Analysis_ humanGenomeSurgery.pdf [2017-09-18]. 9 German national Academy of Sciences Leopoldina et al.

Apparently, speculations now concentrate less on whether but rather only on when the first human genetically modified by genome editing will be born. it is noticeable that policymakers on the national and international levels are adopting a cautious stance when it comes to the demand made in almost all statements � up to the Washington Summit � for broad public debate and for necessary regulations. At the Washington Summit, for instance, the prevailing attitude was that intervention in the human genome could not 12 Event details on http://www.ethikrat.org/veranstaltungen/ jahrestagungen/zugriff-auf-das-menschliche-erbgut. 13 national Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and medicine (2017): human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance.

Given the real application opportunities, there must be a debate about and a decision on whether systematic, transgenerational modifications to the human genome are to be prohibited or authorised and, if they were to be authorised in principle, the extent to which they would need to be limited by conditions and restrictions. For even though man intervenes time and time again in the highly complex fabric of evolution in an increasingly intensive, accelerating and irreversible manner and the current geological epoch is already and rightly being described as �Anthropocene�, the genome nonetheless takes on a factually and symbolically special, even if not exceptional, role because of its impact on individual and collective self-images of mankind. hence, despite its mutability and diversity, its modification cannot be evaluated on the basis of the common categories for the bearing of 15 UnESCo (1997): Universal declaration on the human Genome and human rights. http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-UrL_id=13177&UrL_ do=do_toPiC&UrL_SECtion=201.html [2017-09-18]. 16 Bonas, U. et al.

As research is being conducted worldwide and has, therefore, global consequences, debates of this kind should not be limited to Germany. they must instead be conducted internationally beyond individual nations� initiatives. Scientific research, the results of which could have such fundamental effects on humanity�s self-image, must be embedded in society. it is not an internal affair of the scientific community. nor is it a matter for one country alone � not just because research happens in international networks but, moreover, because the consequences of these research activities affect everyone. that is why the scientific community, in turn, must endeavour to engage in open-ended discussions with all relevant groups amongst the public at large. in parallel to this, the political institutions can and must find ways and initiate processes to discuss the numerous, as yet, unanswered questions and possible consequences of systematic genome manipulations through genome editing in an intensive, differentiated and, above all, global manner, and draw up the necessary regulatory standards as quickly and comprehensively as possible. Before any further precedents are created, the consequences of which may become irreversible at some point, the decisive issues and problems, like the following ones, must be answered and clarified on all levels up to the politically constituted global community: � What are the serious diseases for whose treatment germline intervention methods offer a realistic chance in the foreseeable future because they cannot be treated with traditional methods? What risks and perhaps harm can the individuals, who are the potential participants in the first relevant experiments, be expected to bear for the sake of the scientifically and medically valuable goals (like the treatment of those serious diseases)? to what extent can such risks and harm realistically be reduced or avoided? does it make any difference whether an intervention is made in unfertilised gametes, germline cells or an embryo? What different considerations could possibly play a role here? to what extent do experiments of this kind once again raise the fundamental question about the moral and legal status of the embryo in vitro? � the question must also be raised about where the boundary lies between calculable and not foreseeable, between justifiable and unjustifiable risks. the concept of acceptable risk must, therefore, be specifically determined for these interventions. here, special consideration should be given to the scientific findings of system biology and epigenetics according to which gene activity depends on many factors and external factors, too, can influence gene function for PAGE 5 generations.
