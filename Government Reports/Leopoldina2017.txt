Ethical and legal assessment of genome editing in research on human cells Ulla Bonas B�rbel Friedrich Johannes Fritsch Albrecht M�ller Bettina Sch�ne-Seifert Henning Steinicke Klaus Tanner Jochen Taupitz J�rg Vogel Marcel Weber Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker Background 17 1. Background In recent years, researchers have discovered and developed programmable �gene scissors� (nucleases) that make it possible to cut a genome with unprecedented precision at a specific point and modify it in further steps. To describe these targeted gene changes, which became possible thanks to the huge leaps being made in genome sequencing, the terms �genome surgery� and, in analogy to the editing of books, �genome editing� were introduced. The molecular scissors used, e.g. TALENs and CRISPR-Cas, are being steadily further developed and their use is increasing around the world in basic and applied research in fields including biotechnology, plant and animal breeding, and medicine. With its statement �The opportunities and limits of genome editing�21 published in September 2015, the German Research Foundation (DFG � Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) and the German Academies of Sciences and Humanities already provided information and recommendations on dealing with these methods and their implications. The breadth of the potential application of genome editing, particularly in human medicine, has already led to extensive public debate on an international level, triggered by the International Summit on Human Gene Editing held in December 2015 in Washington DC.22 Numerous science institutions around the globe have since expressed their opinions on the evaluation, development and application of human genome editing in the form of statements and reports, including the UK Nuffield Council on Bioethics, the American National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, and the American College of Medical Genetics 21 The statement is available at: www.leopoldina.org/uploads/tx_ leopublication/2015_3Akad_Stellungnahme_Genome_Editing.pdf 22 Further information: http://nationalacademies.org/gene-editing/Gene-Edit-Summit/ (last accessed: 21 February 2017). Background and Genomics.23 The Federation of European Academies of Medicine (FEAM) held a workshop on 28 April 2016 in Paris entitled �European Workshop on Human Genome Editing: Opportunities and Challenges for Europe�, whose outcomes have been published in form of a report24. The debate covers both a discussion of the potential benefits of the new methods and concerns about potential risks and an overstepping of ethical boundaries. Although the methods of genome editing are based on numerous advances made in molecular genetic research and the associated technologies over the last 50 years, they now enable interventions of such unprecedented precision and efficiency that a reappraisal of the situation is required. The possibilities opened up by genome editing together with the findings from genome sequencing could contribute to substantially improving our understanding of genetic diseases and speed up the development of new therapies. Clinical trials have already been conducted on HIV-infected patients. In these trials, the CCR5 gene, which encodes a surface receptor of immune cells, was modified with the help of gene scissors so that these cells could no longer be infected with HIV. In the course of the study, a significant number of the patients participating were thus able to stop taking their antiretroviral HIV medication completely.25 Further clinical trials are currently being conducted on the 23 Cf.

As a general rule, research projects in this field should of course be conducted transparently and their findings should be published in detail following review. The authors of this discussion paper further advocate the following positions: I. The use of genome editing in research on human embryonic development. The embryonic development of humans differs significantly from that of animals, e.g. mice,32 in a number of aspects, 29 Cf. Leopoldina et al. (2015). The opportunities and limits of genome editing. Available at: www.leopoldina.org/uploads/tx_leopublication/2015_3Akad_Stellungnahme_Genome_Editing.pdf. 30 This Discussion Paper uses the term �embryo� according to the definition used in the German Embryo Protection Act: �For the purpose of this act, an embryo shall already mean the human egg cell, fertilized and capable of developing, from the time of fusion of the nuclei, and further, each totipotent cell removed from an embryo that is assumed to be able to divide and to develop into an individual under the appropriate conditions.� The full text of the German Embryo Protection Act is available at: www. bundesgesundheitsministerium.de/fileadmin/Dateien/3_Downloads/Gesetze_und_ Verordnungen/GuV/E/ESchG_EN_Fassung_Stand_10Dez2014_01.pdf (last accessed: 21 February 2017). 31 Germline cells are all cells that are in a direct developmental lineage from the fertilised egg cell to embryonic, foetal and adult gonads up to mature egg and sperm cells. 32 Cf.

Cell, 165.4, 1012-1026. 2121Position on genetic interventions in somatic cells, germline cells, and embryos including gene expression and cell differentiation. The findings from animal experiments in this research area are thus only transferable to humans to a limited extent. The application of genome editing on human germline cells and early embryos is particularly relevant to the understanding of early human embryogenesis and is therefore practiced in several internationally renowned research institutions, such as the Karolinska Institute in Sweden33. Findings here could lead to improved in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedures and the development of new therapeutic approaches for genetic diseases, for example.34 II. Research on germline gene therapies and effects. Given the current state of research, no targeted germline modifications that have a direct impact on a subsequently born human being should be undertaken. Before any intervention in the germline can even be considered, the techniques must be refined until such an intervention represents an acceptably low risk in comparison to the hereditary disease it seeks to prevent. The empirical bases for such a risk assessment and the subsequent normative evaluation of the risks and opportunities of a germline gene therapy can only be provided through research. Research on somatic gene therapy and, building on this, research on germline cells and embryos are particularly relevant here. III. The use of embryos for research purposes. The use of embryos for medical research purposes should also be permitted in Germany. In view of the controversial societal positions on the protection of embryos and the fact that in spite of the protracted debate it is unlikely that the fundamental disagreement on this subject will be resolved, a sensible compromise in legal policy would be to only allow �orphaned� embryos to be used in research. Orphaned embryos are embryos that were created for reproductive purposes but are definitely no longer going to be used for reproduction and do not have a realistic chance of life. 33 Cf. www.nature.com/news/gene-editing-research-in-human-embryos-gains-momentum-1.19767 (last accessed: 21 February 2017). 34 Cf.

They also raise fundamental questions on ethical and social principles that remain largely unresolved by society at this point and which many believe justify a categorical ban.35 35 Cf. for a critical view e.g. Habermas J.

Violations of this act can be penalised with up to five years of imprisonment. The act, on the other hand, does not explicitly prohibit gene therapy on an embryo that aims to enable its survival or serves its health. The German legal situation regarding non-viable embryos, such as the tripronuclear embryos36 used in the genome editing experiments of Liang et al.37 and Kang et al.38, is unclear. The German Embryo Protection Act clearly does not protect embryos that are not (or no longer) viable. The act is nonetheless based on the assumption that every embryo is viable in the first 24 hours. There is controversy, however, on the concrete development potential required for the cell or group of cells to fall within the protective scope of the German Embryo Protection Act. This uncertainty is of considerable significance to German researchers as they can already be penalised for supporting such research on human embryos abroad if they are based on German territory � even if these experiments are legally permitted in the respective country. German researchers are therefore generally not allowed to participate in international research projects involving human embryos. In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) has become established across the world as the standard therapy for certain forms of infertility. As with natural fertilisation, the majority of embryos produced by IVF are non-viable 36 These non-viable embryos are sometimes unintentionally generated in IVF-clinics by division of the pronuclei of a fertilised egg cell or by fusion of an egg cell with two sperm cells. 37 Cf.

In Germany, too, though on a smaller scale, embryos produced for reproductive purposes may ultimately not be used for this purpose and be discarded. This can be the case if the treating doctor decides, on the basis of morphological and biochemical criteria, that the embryos are not suitable for implantation. Also, embryos are �left over� if the woman or the couple decide that they no longer want an implantation. This could happen in the event that pre-implantation genetic diagnosis reveals dispositions for a severe hereditary disease or if the prospective parents reach a point where they generally decide that they no longer want another pregnancy and are opposed to prenatal adoption of the embryos that are no longer going to be used for reproductive purposes.40 In the opinion of the authors research should be permitted, with the consent of the �parents�, on such embryos which have no realistic chance of life. This use, in combination with the progress in genome sequencing and genome editing, could result in valuable research findings of relevance to medicine. Research on embryos that would otherwise be discarded should, however, be exclusively restricted to medical purposes and only permitted in the very early phases of development. Regulations in place in various countries, such as the United Kingdom, Sweden and France, where research is only permitted on embryos up to a maximum period of 14 days following fertilisation of the egg cells, could serve as a blueprint for Germany. In the United Kingdom, for example, the national regulating body, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) licenses assisted conception procedures, fertility clinics and IVF centres and research projects on human embryos that are no longer going to be used for reproductive purposes. The 39 It is inherently difficult to collect reliable data here. It is however estimated that only approx. 30% of all �naturally� fertilised eggs result in a live birth. Cf. Macklon N. S. et al. (2002). Conception to ongoing pregnancy: the �black box� of early pregnancy loss. Human reproduction update, 8(4): 333-343. 40 By 2012 the centres of the German Embryo Donation Network alone were storing approx. 28,500 pronuclear stages and approx. 5000 embryos.

This position is called into question by many and is not implemented consistently in German law.41 Embryos need to be protected from arbitrary use � that is beyond contention. For this reason, research even on the group of early embryos that have no realistic chance of life should only be permitted if scientific justification is provided that such research serves particularly important research objectives. Such research objectives also include advancing the state of medicine in the development of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic procedures for human application. A narrowly defined further development of the current legislation, as advocated in this paper, would enable Germany not only to participate in the relevant international research itself, but also to take an active part in shaping the international legal and ethical environment for this research field and thus in developing new forms of treatment for genetic diseases. In this context, the authors would like to trigger a renewed and differentiated debate on research on early human embryos that would otherwise be discarded. This debate should be shaped jointly by the scientific community together with policymakers and the general public in Germany and explore the different ethical stances on embryo protection and the reasoning, contexts and further developments involved. In addition to exploring the public legal-ethical acceptance of such research in Germany, the concrete research needs of German scientists should also be investigated. 41 Cf.
