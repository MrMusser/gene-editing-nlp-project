The opportunities and limits of genome editinThe opportunities and limits of genome editingSummary Summary Modern molecular techniques often referred to as �genome editing� or �genome surgery� are currently revolutionising molecular biology research. Technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 allow for surprisingly simple, controlled gene modifications that are more efficient than the previously available methods. This opens up new scope for molecular biological basic research, particularly into organisms that were not previously accessible for molecular genetic purposes, and for elucidating poorly understood gene functions. This methological innovation also allows for far-reaching applications, from new options for plant breeding and biotechnology to somatic gene therapy for human genetic diseases. Focused basic research is still required, and Germany should be contributing on all levels to these important developments, as well as helping to ensure a safe and responsible application of genome editing that respects the needs of humanity and the environment. In April 2015, Chinese researchers studied the potential CRISPR-Cas9 has to change the human genome in non-viable human embryos. The results of the study show that the methods behind such an application are far from adequately developed. Such experiments also raise far-reaching social, ethical and legal questions regarding the treatment of hereditary diseases and the integrity of the human germline; they also come close to overstepping the boundaries of scientific freedom. In Germany, germline therapy and the use of modified germ cells for fertilisation is prohibited under Section 5 of the German Embryo Protection Act. The National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, acatech � the National Academy of Science and Engineering, the Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities, and the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft � DFG) stress the great scientific potential of genome editing. They point out that it is ethically and legally acceptable in many areas. The new techniques should not be automatically equated with sporadic cases of improper use or with applications whose ethical and legal ramifications have not yet been assessed. The DFG and the academies endorse the call for an international moratorium on all forms of human germline engineering that could have an impact on the genome of the offspring. The moratorium should give scientists, politicians and society the opportunity to discuss unresolved questions in a transparent and critical way, to evaluate the benefits and potential risks of the techniques, and to developrecommendations for future regulations. However, the moratorium should not constitute a general restriction on methodological developments and thus limit any promising new genome editing approaches for use in research and application. Background to the Statement 1. Background to the Statement New methods of genome editing, in particular the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, were developed a few years ago as molecular genetic tools. Because they are simple, time-saving and cost-effective in comparison to conventional methods, they have already been applied worldwide in molecular genetic research, biotechnology and biomedicine. It must be stressed that most of the wide range of possible uses of genome editing in basic research and application are ethically and legally acceptable. At the same time, the new procedures are raising questions about the responsible limits of their use. In experiments on non-viable human embryos1,Chinese researchers showed that the genome editing approaches currently available for these types of cells are still not efficient and accurate enough for responsible medical application. Their findings have retriggered the debate on whether and under what conditions gene therapies � particularly those affecting the germline � should be possible in the future. There have been calls for a voluntary international moratorium that would prohibit all forms of molecular genetic intervention in the human germline. 1 This statement uses the term �embryo� according to the definition used in the German Embryo Protection Act. Principles of genome editing 2. Principles of genome editing Since restriction endonucleases (�gene scissors�) were discovered over 40 years ago, molecular biologists have been in a position to modify specific genes within the genome. Over the past few years, so-called �zinc finger nucleases�, TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases), and CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats � CRISPR-associated proteins) have been discovered and developed as gene scissors. This has given researchers working in molecular genetics a new range of tools that can precisely target and make a cut at almost any point in the DNA sequence of the genome. This allows the additional step of precisely exchanging or removing specific DNA building blocks or entire DNA stretches. While the programming and use of zinc finger nucleases and TALEN is still quite cumbersome and expensive, the CRISPR-Cas9 method can be used very efficiently, saving time and costs. It is therefore becoming commonplace in more and more research laboratories worldwide. The CRISPR sequences were discovered in the bacterium Escherichia coli in 1987.2 It was not until 20 years later that scientists realised that these periodic blocks of nearly identical DNA sequences occur in the genome of numerous bacteria and archaea, and are part of their adaptive immune system to protect against bacteriophage infections.3 This system also includes the Cas proteins, gene scissors that can bind specific RNA sequences, which subsequently act as guide molecules. The bound guide RNA ultimately determines which complementary DNA within the genome is targeted and precisely cut by the gene scissors. A major breakthrough in the application of CRISPR-Cas9 for genome editing was achieved in 2012, when research groups led by Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna deciphered the basic mechanisms of guide RNA binding and the target recognition of the system and were thus able to develop these elements into a biotechnological tool for the first time.4 2 Cf.

Within a short time, the CRISPR-Cas9 technique has already been applied to several microorganisms, plants and animals (including monkeys5) and to human cells6, and now even organisms that were hitherto largely inaccessible for molecular genetic studies have become available for research and applications.7 In addition, the technique�s precision and efficiency makes it possible to elucidate the functions of previously poorly understood genes and gene variants, as well as their interactions in gene networks. Previously, especially when working with more complex animals and plants, the deactivation or modification of individual genes would usually require a very large number of test animals and plants and would take several months or years. Due to the specific functional mechanism and the higher selectivity and efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9, different genes in a variety of organisms can now 5 Cf.

In principle, the number of test subjects required for the respective research projects can thus be significantly reduced, and procedures such as gene drive (see Ch. 3.3) become feasible. The possibility of simultaneously introducing several targeted genetic modifications in principal allows researchers to reconstruct relevant complex genetic structures of human multi-factorial diseases (e.g. Alzheimer�s disease or cardiovascular disease) in model organisms. Therefore, the causes and progression of these diseases could also be explored more efficiently than previously, as could potential therapies and preventive measures. 3.2 Application in biotechnology and plant breeding The use of modern genome editing methods is of increasing interest due to the significant reductions in time and cost they offer over conventional processes. In view of the relatively short time genome editing has been available, it has opened up an astonishing number of new application approaches. Applications to date include: � Creation of a yeast strain with an increased yield of mevalonate, a key substance in the synthesis of anti-cancer drugs, nutritional supplements and anti-malaria drugs8 8 Cf.

A statement by Germany�s Central Committee on Biosafety (ZKBS) classifies organisms modified by means of zinc finger nucleases as �not genetically modified� when the gene scissors were introduced into the cells as an encoding RNA or as a protein. The ZKBS reached a similar conclusion when evaluating oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, also known as RTDS (rapid trait development system). In this genome editing process, the natural mechanism of gene repair in plants is used to deliberately create mutations.15 In some cases, the new plant varieties obtained by means of genome editing are not readily distinguishable from conventionally bred plants, e.g. those bred using chemicals or irradiation. The academies have already taken a stance on the far-reaching regulatory consequences for the classification, assessment and approval of the plant varieties obtained by new molecular breeding methods.16 3.3 The special situation of the gene-drive technique Gene drive increases the effectiveness of transmission of individual genes to the progeny in higher organisms by more than the usual 50 percent. This can occur through the transfer of individual genes or gene mutations to further chromosomes using endogenous enzymes active in the germline, so that multiple copies of a gene 15 See the statement by the ZKBS available at: www.bvl. bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/06_Gentechnik/ ZKBS/02_Allgemeine_Stellungnahmen_englisch/05_ plants/zkbs_plants_new_plant_breeding_techniques. pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=2 (last accessed: 31 August 2015).

There have been proposals to use gene drive to introduce modified genes into wild-type pest populations in a bid to render them harmless.18 It could be applied, for example, in the fight against malaria and dengue fever or in the containment of invasive species, such as cane toads and rats in Australia. Malaria pathogens are transmitted to humans by the Anopheles mosquito. For many years, researchers worldwide have been working to curb the spread of malaria by creating genetically modified Anopheles mosquitoes that cannot transmit the malaria pathogens. Thus far, they have had only limited success. Mutagenic chain reaction, an instance of the gene-drive technique that was recently further developed in fruit fly models, involves a genetic element based on the CRISPR-Cas9 system being inserted into the genome of the fly.19 The genetic modification spreads in a very efficient and targeted manner to both copies of the gene in question, including in subsequent filial generations. Thus, almost all offspring of crossbreeding with such a recombinant organism become homozygous for the new gene variant. However, to spread the genetic modification over an entire population within ten to twenty generations, a very large number of modified organisms, representing a substantial proportion of the existing total population, must be introduced. The modified organisms also remain subject to natural selection, and might therefore only be able to sustainably spread in nature if they survive until 17 These natural and widespread DNA sequences are often called �selfish genetic elements� and include transposons, retrotransposons, IS elements and endogenous viruses.

Interventions in ecosystems � whether the goal is to eradicate epidemicsor to control crop pests � can have far-reaching consequences. Therefore, we need to develop appropriate protective and/or retrieval measures and to conduct social discourse on the use of this technique and where its boundaries should lie.20 3.4 Application in medicine Since CRISPR-Cas9 is being successfully applied in basic research and biotechnology, it would seem worthwhile to devote more attention to exploring its possibilities in medicine. A recent publication presented the first successful application of CRISPR-Cas9 in correcting an inherited mutation in mice and thus curing the metabolic disease tyrosinemia.21 Moreover, researchers were able to alter the gene CCR5 in human blood stem cells to recreate the naturally occurring mutation that a few individuals in the world have, giving them an innate resistance to HIV.22 These two advances are impressive examples of the potential of the method. And yet, the tyrosinemia example also shows the shortcomings in the current state of development. Large quantities of liquid had to be introduced into the blood of the mice for sufficient Cas9 enzyme and guide 20 Cf.

The scientific community expects to see clinical trials with CRISPR-Cas9-based gene therapies for somatic cells in the coming years. The CRISPR-Cas9-components can be introduced either via direct injection into organs or tissue, or by treating certain types of cells outside of the body � e.g. blood stem cells from patients with hereditary blood disorders, metabolic disorders or immune deficiencies � and then transplanting them back. However, before the technique can be used in medical applications, there are several challenges to overcome. First, the basic molecular mechanisms of the CRISPR-Cas9 system must be explored further. Moreover, there must be an increase in efficiency, selectivity and safety, so that only the specifically desired cell types are genetically modified, and unintended mutations elsewhere in the genome (off-target mutations) are prevented. There is still a significant lack of the necessary insight into the complex interplay between human genes and/or individual gene variants and of genome-wide knowledge about the functioning of the chromatin that packages the DNA. It is at this epigenetic level that decisions are made on whether, and to what extent, a particular gene is activated or inhibited. Scientists are only just beginning to gain a rudimentary understanding of chroma23 Cf.

That means that they are not yet able to reliably predict the long-term consequences of even simple genetic changes. Interestingly, CRISPR-Cas9 is becoming a key technology in this area too, as it has enabled scientists to influence the epigenome in a targeted way for the first time24 and has placed completely new possibilities at the fingertips of epigeneticists. 3.5 Genetic interventions in the human germline In April 2015, Chinese scientists published their studies into genome editing in human embryos.25 The researchers had deliberately selected abnormal embryos rejected by an in vitro fertility clinic. To investigate the potential of the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, a mutation was to be introduced into the beta globin gene of these non-viable embryos. Mutations in this gene lead to thalassemia, an autosomal recessive blood disorder common in China. The low efficiency and numerous off-target mutations that the Chinese researchers documented as a result of their experiments show that such an application of theCRISPR-Cas9 technique is still very much in the development phase. For the time being, therefore, scientists should remain realistic about the potential applications and not raise unfounded fears or exaggerated hopes, as happened in the early 1990s following the first clinical trials of gene therapy. The Chinese publication re-ignited the debate on whether and under what conditions gene therapies that affect the human germline should be possible in 24 Cf.

Many scientists have already called for a voluntary international moratorium26 to allow time to discuss the scientific, medical, ethical, legal and regulatory implications of genome editing of human germline cells27 before any applications are ready. While genetic modifications of the human germline are prohibited in Germany28 and in 13 other European countries29, some international opinion leaders, for example in the United States and the United Kingdom30, are prepared to consider certain exceptions. Such exceptions might be for basic research into treatment of serious monogenic hereditary diseases, i.e. diseases caused by mutation in a single gene, or for efforts to minimise the risks associated with certain infectious and common diseases. 26 Cf. Baltimore D et al. (2015) �A prudent path forward for genomic engineering and germline gene modification�. Science 348(6230): 36�38 and Lanphier E et al. (2015) �Don�t edit the human germ line�. Nature 519: 410�411 as well as footnote 28. 27 Germ line cells are, for the purpose of the German Embryo Protection Act, �all cells that, in one cell-line, lead from the fertilised egg to the egg and sperm cells of the resultant human being and, further, the egg cell from the insertion of or penetration by the sperm cell until the completion of fertilisation by fusion of the nuclei�. 28 Cf.

The paper analyses the loopholes and inconsistencies in the Embryo Protection Act with regard to germline interventions. For example, the ban in Section 5 of the German Embryo Protection Act only rests on the assumption that �the technique of gene transfer into human germline cells cannot be developed without prior experimentation on humans� and the declaration that �the irreversible consequences of the failures that are to be expected in the experimental phase [�] cannot be justified, at least according to the present state of knowledge�. This rationale would no longer apply should the consequences of a germline modification be able to be predicted with adequate certainty in the future. In addition, in the scientific community, up to the Court, the terms �embryo� and �germ line� are partly used with quite different meanings. A moratorium should also take into account the need to harmonize the understanding of these concepts. 29 Cf. Araki M and Ishii T (2014). �International regulatory landscape and integration of corrective genome editing into in vitro fertilization.� Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology 12(1): 108. 30 Cf. joint statement of UK science bodies (2015) �Genome editing in human cells � initial joint statement�. Available at: www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/ corporatesite/@policy_communications/documents/ web_document/wtp059707.pdf (last accessed: 17 September 2015). We are far from understanding the �concert of human genes�. Even targeted modification of genetic information in the human germline may have an unforeseeable impact. Even if the efficiency, specificity and safety of genome editing do one day meet the requirements for the responsible application of the techniques and can be used to stop severe hereditary diseases being passed on to subsequent generations, it must be clear whether and under what circumstances intervention in the germline is acceptable. A moratorium should ensure that � in the future, too � these methods are dealt with safely, transparently and in accordance with ethical principles. Consequences and recommendations 4. Consequences and recommendations 1. The DFG and the academies consider it important to stress the great potential of genome editing as a scientific technique, that it is ethically and legally acceptable in many areas, and that these methods should not be automatically equated with applications whose ethical and legal ramifications have not yet been assessed. The new techniques promise more efficient, more targeted and thus more controllable genetic modifications than has been possible with the methods available to date. They open up new dimensions for all molecular biological basic research and for potential applications in plant breeding, industrial biotechnology and biomedicine. 2. Alongside the scientific dialogue that has already begun, there should be public debate on the scientific, ethical and legal possibilities of genome editing and on its limits and consequences, particularly with regard to therapeutic applications and to targeted, potentially far-reaching interventions in ecosystems. It is important to have an objective debate that informs all stakeholders in a clear and transparent manner about the status of research and development into the techniques, and to ensure that any decisions taken are based on sound scientific evidence. The techniques should be studied and improved further, and Germany should be contributing on all levels to these important developments,as well as helping to ensure a safe and responsible application of genome editing that respects the needs of humanity and the environment. 3. Before we can properly assess the potential medical applications of genome editing, we must gain an explicit overview of the concrete differences between, and advantages and disadvantages of, gene therapy of somatic cells on the one hand and inheritable genetic changes in germline cells on the other. And before we can use these new genome editing techniques for somatic gene therapy, for example on blood stem cells from patients with hereditary blood disorders, metabolic defects or immunodeficiencies,we must carefully research the pros and cons and in particular the long-term effects, and compare these with established procedures such as stem cell transplantation. 4. The DFG and the academies endorse the call for an international voluntary moratorium on all forms of human germline engineering that could have an impact on the genome of the offspring. The moratorium should give us all the opportunity to discuss unresolved questions in a transparent and critical way,to evaluate the benefits and potential risks of the techniques,and to develop recommendations for future regulations. The moratorium should also take into account the need to harmonize the definition of the terms �embryo� and �germ line� (see footnote 28, page 26). However, it should not constitute a general restriction on methodological developments and thus limit any promising new genome editing approaches for use in research and application. The statement by the �Gene Technology Report� interdisciplinary working group at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities examines in detail the ethical, legal, social and political ramifications of genome editing in humans.31 31 Cf.

It is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between the genetic modifications in animal and plant cultivation and breeding that are obtained by natural processes, through conventional breeding methods, and by means of genome editing. There is thus a clear need for new processes for the product-based assessment and regulation of �genetically modified� organisms. We must also ensure that the quality of biological safety research in Germany remains at a high level.32 32 Cf. Leopoldina et al.
